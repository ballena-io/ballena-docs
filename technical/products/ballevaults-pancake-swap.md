# BalleVaults - Pancake Swap

## Active Vaults <a id="active-vaults"></a>

Vaults serve as passive token generator for users who provide liquidity to them. The farmed revenue has 3 destinations:

* Part of the revenue is returned to the BalleVaults´ users as LP tokens.
* Pay the gas fees of harvest calls \(0.1% fee is applied for each call\).
* The rest is distributed to users who stake BALLE in the [BALLE Reward Pool](balle-staking-pool.md). This reward fee is a 3% of the total revenue of the platform. These users are also able to participate in the voting process of the community, discover more in [Governance](../governance.md).



The BalleVaults´ users will receive a reward in the form of BALLE tokens as stated [here](../tokenomics.md#platform-users-distribution-yield-optimizer-app). These tokens can be reinvested in the BALLE Staking Pool for further yield and benefits.



## Simple Mode BalleVaults

This strategy farms one only token. You can see currently active vaults listed here:

#### CAKE SMART
