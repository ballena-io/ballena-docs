# BALLE Staking Pool

BALLE is the native gobernance token. Staking BALLE tokens on the gobernance pool will get you revenue from the platform lifetime. Thus, you will receive BALLE tokens as revenue, helping it rise its price at the same time. Apart from its high profitability due to its rising value, you will be able to be part of the governance of the token, meaning users will be able to vote and practice staking gaining some of the platform transaction fees as a reward.

Users actively participating in the Balle Staking Pool will receive 3% of the revenue obtained from the revenue of the platform by all users. They will also be rewarded with an extra 12000 tokens distributed as a multiplier to the 3% fee clearly shown in the Governance App.

Receiving BALLE tokens, as well as an extra reward just for having them deposited in the Staking Pool, makes it a high profitable strategy, especially when the token supply is limited.
