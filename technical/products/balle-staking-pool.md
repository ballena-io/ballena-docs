# BALLE Staking Pool

### Participate in the BALLE Staking Pool and receive more BALLE. The holders who participate in the Staking get 3% of all the profits of the platform, and in addition, BALLE token extra rewards!



The BALLE token is the native governance token. By participating in the staking of the BALLE token, you will receive a portion of the total benefits of the platform. In addition to contributing to its revaluation and enhancing the platform, you will thus be able to participate in the governance process of our DAO, that is, you will be able to propose and vote on proposals on our platform.

Staking BALLE tokens on the governance pool will get you revenue from the platform lifetime.

Users actively participating in the Balle Staking Pool will receive 3% of the total revenue of the platform generated by all users. 

In addition, an extra reward of 12,000 tokens is distributed to these users. The distribution is carried out as a multiplier that acts on this 3% rate. The user, therefore, will receive the corresponding portion of the profits, multiplied by this factor, in BALLE tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
The BALLE token is the governance token of [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/). Its value lies in the long-term benefit of holding it, derived from the profits of the platform distributed among the users who own it as the TVL and the products offered on the platform increase. The dev. team and a strong community focused on the long-term sustainability of the project, as well as a limited supply of tokens, make the BALLE token a highly valued asset. 

The value of the token will suffer ups and downs like any asset on the market, it is not designed to profit the holder by buying and selling in relation to its changes in value, but through its holding, which allows the holder to receive constantly and indefinitely a percentage of the total profits of the platform.

### The process

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) receives 3% of the total revenue obtained on the platform each week, which is then distributed among users who participate in the BALLE Staking Pool. These accumulated earnings are distributed among these users throughout the following week, where each one of them will receive the proportional part that corresponds to them based on the amount of tokens deposited in the pool.

While this revenue is distributed during the following week, the platform is again in charge of collecting the platform's profits for them to be distributed the next week, and so on. 

In addition, the extra reward of 12,000 BALLE tokens is also distributed to these users who participate in Staking, a distribution that is regulated by the multiplier observed in the pool. This multiplier will mark the number of tokens that are distributed along with the earnings of the platform. Since the objective of this product is to distribute part of the profits of the platform and be sustained by them, the multiplier will be varied to satisfy the needs of the project. 

After the launch of the platform, the multiplier will be higher, since having a lower TVL, the benefits of the platform will not be high enough to offer an attractive APY. In this way, the extra BALLE tokens will turn the APY into very profitable ranges. 

Once the platform has more TVL, its profits will increase and therefore the users who participate in the BALLE Staking Pool will benefit from a very attractive APY without the need for the excessive extra distribution of BALLE tokens, gradually decreasing their distribution until reaching a point of total sustainability of the pool purely based on the profits of the platform. 

The following illustration shows in detail the collection and distribution process received by users of the BALLE Staking Pool:
