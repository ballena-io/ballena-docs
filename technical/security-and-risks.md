# Security and Risks

In the space of crypto, especially in the Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\) space, users have to understand the risks of projects and smart contracts before venturing into DeFi. We call this DYOR \(do your own research\).



## General DeFi Risks

DeFi risks encapsulates a wide range of risks such as [impermanent loss](https://www.bsc.news/post/cryptonomics-what-is-impermanent-loss) to risks of falling for scams such as wallet draining, private key being stolen, et cetera. Hence, DeFi users have to be careful themselves and learn to educate themselves constantly in this space. You can find a guide to keeping your funds SAFU [here](https://letmeape.medium.com/how-to-keep-your-funds-safe-metamask-guide-816773968310).



## 3rd Party Risks

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) serves as a yield aggregator by providing vaults which auto-compounds rewards. We've verified the security of each of the vaults before publishing. However, vaults does not indicate any partnership or support by [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/).

## Wallet Safety

We are glad to announce **we are the first project working with Gnosis** Multisig system in the Binance Smart Chain. 

A multiple signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that controls access and changes to one or more Smart Contracts. Most of the community governed projects in the Ethereum network often require multiple signers to approve a transaction before it will be executed. In Binance Smart Chain, we are the first project implementing Gnosis Safe to run our DAO. 

In BALLE we have designed a 2 safes structure:

1. The treasury operations protocol. The treasury consists of 9 wallets, where 6 of 9 community wallet signers must agree to sign a transaction before a Smart Contract can be implemented oor any changes made regarding trasury funds.
2. The emergency safe protocol, where only 2 main signatures are required in order to perfom some actions. These actions include safety features like closing a failing or hacked vault, i.e.

## Smart Contracts

### Audits

Audits in progress. Published here soon.



### Deployed

All deployed contracts have verified and published source codes on [tokenomics](tokenomics.md) and BscScan.

Total supply was minted and deposited to corresponding Smart Contracts for distribution: 

* Platform users rewards, 24,000 BALLE in Smart Contracts: 0x2305423942390582058092. 
* BALLE holders rewards, 13,000 BALLE in Smart Contracts: 0x2305423942390582058092.
* Dev Team funds, 3000 BALLE in Smart Contracts:

  * 0x2305423942390582058092.
  * 0x2305423942390582058092.
  * 0x2305423942390582058092.

No more supply is possible, minter account was removed from Smart Contractsand is not possible to set a new one. 

Transactions: 0x2305423942390582058092 and 0x2305423942390582058092.
