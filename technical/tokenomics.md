# Tokenomics

## Max Supply: 40000 BALLE

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) started with no pre-sale and has an immutable max supply of 40000 BALLE token. All of them will be freely distributed to our community of users and holders and a small amount allocated to our Dev. Team and promotion purposes.

### **Percentage Breakdown**

Total fix supply distributed as:

* **60% - 24000 BALLE tokens:** Distributed among the BalleVaults users.
* **30% - 12000 BALLE tokens:** Distributed as an extra reward

   among the BALLE holders involved in the BALLE Staking Pool.

* **10% - 4000 BALLE tokens:** DAO funds for purposes such as liquidity, aridrops and contribution rewards.

## Details:

**Fixed Supply Tokenomics:** All tokens are minted and will be freely distributed. No more minting possible.

**Utility:** Fees from the ecosystem will go to token holders. 

* 4% of the revenue from our Yield Optimizer App is distributed among the users who participate in the BALLE Staking Pool \(3%\) and the project´s treasury \(1%\).
* 10% of the revenue generated at the BALLE Staking Pool is destined to the project´s treasury for the DAO´s future expenses. This is a temporary fee, applicable while the 12,000 BALLE are distributed through this pool.

## How distribution works

All distribution mechanisms are already implemented in our Smart Contracts. Only a multiplier can be modified in order to adjust the rewards rate for certain pools. All info will be clearly stated on the user interface.

A total of 36000 BALLE tokens will be distributed among Yield Optimizer App and Governance App users accordingly.



### Platform users distribution \(Yield Optimizer App\)

This distribution will work over the first year and consists of 24000 BALLE tokens distributed among all users actively participating in our products. Using the BalleVaults, i.e. CAKE-BNB Vault, will result in a reward of BALLE tokens, apart from increasing your LP tokens, obviously.

Every 3 seconds a BSC block is released. At the same time, a fixed BALLE amount is released per block, which is divided by the number of active vaults on the platform. Users will receive a proportional amount of BALLE token regarding their pool share amount times the multiplier stated on each one of them. This multiplier serves the Dev. Team as an adjustable trimmer for the proper development of the project, thus some of the vaults will reward the user with a greater amount of BALLE tokens.



### BALLE holders distribution \(Governance App\)

BALLE holders actively participating in the Governance APP \(BALLEReward Pool or BALLE Staking Pool\) will receive a 3% of the Yield Optimizer App revenue. Apart from these gains, BALLE holders actively participating in the BALLE staking pool, or governance pool, will be rewarded with an extra 13000 BALLE token distribution.

This extra reward will be distributed as a multiplier to the standard fee allocation resulting from the Yield Optimizer App revenue. The extra reward multiplier will clearly appear as a x10, x100 or x200 multiplier in the BALLE staking pool, meaning the user will receive the fees proportional amount of BALLE regarding his pool share multiplied by this value.



## Fees

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) products must comply with some fees stated below:

* The 4% of the platform´s total revenue are distributed as:
  * 3% for the BALLE holders actively participating in the BALLE Staking Pool.
  * 1% allocated to the project treasury \(this amount faces the reinvesting fees and Smart Contracts deployment fees\).
* A 10% of the Governance Pool´s extra reward is also allocated to the treasury only during its distribution process.
* 0.1% is the vaults´ harvest fee.
