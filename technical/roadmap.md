# Roadmap

We know that this is not exactly a regular roadmap, but a list of tasks with no particular order nor estimated times. Each epic task on this list is in turn subdivided into small tasks by the development team.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the nature of the project, we work as fast as we can on what we consider priority objectives. The ability to pivot and react are essential.
