# Governance

Holders of BALLE! You are eligible to receive part of the profits as you have constructed, **you own and govern the Ballena ecosystem**. You will receive revenue, for each of the BALLE tokens you hold, that arises from the yielding exercise of this platform. And you will also be eligible to vote any changes on the BALLE platform as a token holder.

The [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) project is **governed by a DAO**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. This means that the community users who own the governance token, the BALLE token, are the ones who control the organization, and therefore, the project.



### How can you control the direction of the project?

Users who own the BALLE token can participate in the governance through the [voting platform](https://vote.ballena.io/#/ballena). 

Here, you can create proposals and vote on those that are active. You can find more information in the DAO tutorials: 

* [Create proposals](../dao-organization/dao-tutorials/create-propolsals.md). 
* [Vote](../dao-organization/dao-tutorials/vote.md). 

In addition, holding the BALLE token and participating in the BALLE Staking Pool, or Governance App, **rewards the user with fees generated on the platform**. They will receive 3% of the profits obtained by users in the Yield Optimizer App, and in addition, an **extra reward of 12,000 tokens**.



### Extra reward, 12000 BALLE Tokens!

Apart from the stated fee reward earned by the users, they will be allocated an extra reward of 12000 tokens as a multiplier to this fee. Holding BALLE gets really profitable and lets you decide the future of the project.

The extra reward will be distributed as a multiplier to the standard fee allocation resulting from the Yield Optimizer App revenue. The extra reward multiplier will clearly appear as a x10, x100 or x200 multiplier in the BALLE staking pool, meaning the user will receive the fees proportional amount of BALLE regarding his pool share multiplied by this value.

These users staking The BALLE tokens into the [Governance Pool](products/balle-staking-pool.md) will receive a 3% of the total revenue from the Yield Optimizer App. This revenue can be withdrawn at any time with no penalty. â€‹
