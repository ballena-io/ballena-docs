# Getting started

## What are DeFi´s and why are they trending? 

DeFi for ‘Decentralized Finance’. There is no institution that governs the app. This avoids manipulation, embezzlement and those high fees we are used to. 

Every day, new projects are launched with different aims like, solving existing problems, investment, etc. [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) has been created to **reinvest your profits automatically into different investment funds** so you don´t have to do it by yourself. This way, you maximise them **exponentially**.

In DeFi, all the profits are distributed within the Comunity, just unlike banks, where people get a little amount of interest for keeping their money on their institutions, while just a few are getting the most of it. 

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) app, works as a bond between people and liquidity funds. In this kind of platforms, you can usually harvest the profits manually to cash them out, or just to reinvest them into the platform after paying a fee.

One of the main aims of [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) is to **reinvest continously and automatically all your profits, so they grow exponentially**. This is better known as **compound interest**. 

See the graphic below to understand how it works. The blue line stands for what is called, simple interest, where the profits are not being reinvested. The orange line instead, shows the progression made by **compound interest**, where the profits are being reinvested continously.

Here an example. Let’s say you have invested 100€. If you get 1% daily, you would have 365\*1€ = 365€, at the end of the year. 

But, if you reinvest that 1€ daily profit, the 1% daily interest of the following days, will be calculated based on a higher amount of money, so you will get higher profits that will grow exponentially to exactly 3,847.27€ at the end of the year. 

**This is what** [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) **does.** 

Besides, our developers team is constantly looking for the best oportunities to implement the most optimized strategies for each of them.



## Why investing in ballena.io? 

If you are thinking about investing in a DeFi project, first of all you will have to understand:

* Who is behind the project. 
* What is its goal. 
* Who and how the decissions are made. 
* What liquidity funds it works with. 
* What are its yields. 
* Its comunity and accesibility.



Our project [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/), is completely clear and accessible for everybody. Please check the documentation for more information. You will be able to check the tokenomics, where we explain the project finances and how they are managed. Find the answers to this questions below.



### Who is behind the project?

Behind the project there is a huge comunity, born in Telegram with the aim of creating a work team within the crypto space. With over 7,000 users in the group, we have become a DAO \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\) where the organization is coordinated autonomously by smart contracts. In other words, **all the decissions are made by the whole comunity** and not by just a few.

### What is its goal?

Our goal is to offer a high performance quality product for the general public. We got social and lucrative interest for the whole comunity at free access. Also we work to fight the language barrier as many of the DeFi platforms are English based, whilst we bet that the **Spanish-speaking public** is huge. This is why we offer both options. Another goal for what we work hard, is to bring DeFi to **unexperienced users**. We make it uncomplicated for everbody.



### Who and how the decissions are made?

All the decissions are made within the comunity, by the BALLE token holders. If you own any BALLE token, you will be elegible to vote.

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/)  has got a [voting platform](https://vote.ballena.io/), where changes are proposed and voted by the users to be applied.



### Who manages the project’s treasury funds?

The project has got a treasury which gets a minimum percentage of the platform profits which are destinated to: 

* The platform´s management.
* Transaction fees.
* Promoting costs.



The treasury funds are managed by a **multi-sign system called Gnosis Safe**. It actually requires a **mínimum of signs from the comunity to carry out any movement**, avoiding that way, any kind of embezzlement.



### Yields

The yields at the platform are quite high as you can see under the APY value within any of the products. Returns are a way higher than any other traditional investment fund. Further, the users at the platform are rewarded in BALLE tokens. Due to the utility of the project, the token will gradually and quickly increase its value, generating this way, an extra profit.

In other words, you will **get a profit for providing funds and also, you´ll get an extra reward in BALLE tokens**. As an additional advantage, the system will let you reinvesting your BALLE tokens and they will start generating more profits. As you already know, BALLE tokens not only have market value, but you will be allowed to vote in the platform.

Apart from that, you will have to consider **cryptocurrency fluctuations** to calculate your profits. The amount of provided tokens will always increase, based on an exponential ratio. If the value of the crypto you decide to provide, increases or decreases, it will cause an **impact on your investment value**. If the tokens’ value increases, you will have earned much more profits, and if it decreases, you will be losing as long as its value doesn’t drop as much to offset the extra tokens. 

For example, you provide 10 $BNB tokens to a liquidity fund in ballena.io and after some time, those tokens get into 11 due to the profits obtained thanks to the compound interest offered by the platform. Your equity has increased, but you must pay attention on the $BNB token value to see if you are actually in profits or even losing. If $BNB was 100€ x 10 tokens = 1000€ is that you would have invested at first. 

* In case it has got the same value, 100€, you would have 11 tokens that worth 1100€. We would have earned 100€. 
* In the case the token has increased its value to 200€, then you got 11 tokens at a total value of 2200€. You would have earned 1200€, 1000€ due to it´s revaluation, and 200€ due to the extra $BNB token. 
* As last, let´s say $BNB drops down to 80€, you have 11 tokens that worth 880€. You would have lost 120€ thanks to the extra $BNB token and the compound interest, otherwise the lost would have been 200€. 

This is the reason why it is so important to **choose carefully what projects you want to invest in**.[ ](https://vote.ballena.io/)[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) will help you to increase the amount of tokens you own, but we got nothing to do with the price fluctuations of them. The amount of provided tokens will always be the same, and the amount of generated tokens due to compound interest, will increase exponentially. But this is got nothing to do with their value. 

Having said that, you will have to watch out the trend and periodically check the value of the cryptos you provided.

Another great point about [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/), is the **huge cost reduction per user in regard to transaction fees**. An average user would shock after realising about how expensive it can be doing it on his own. In [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/), all the reinvesting transactions are made together for the same value, so **the impact on the user is ridiculously low and inappreciable**, because you split the cost with thousands of users. 



### What liquidity funds it works with?

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) works with two different liquidity funds. 

* On one side, the comunity BALLE fund, called **BALLE Staking Pool**. Please find the contracts within the documentation. 
* On the other side, [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) works on [PancakeSwap ](https://pancakeswap.finance/)funds. One of the best DeFi platforms so far. Please check their code and [safety audits](https://certik-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/REP-PancakeSwap-16_10_2020.pdf) on their platform documentation.



### Is it complicated to use [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) or any other DeFi platform of this kind?

Yes, it can be difficult at first. It is necessary that someone gives you a hand to get started, as they are complicated if you have no experience. 

No to worry! We have realised about that fact, that´s why we have created step-by-step tutorials and resources to make it easier for you. This project has born for a common interest, looking for the highest yields for all of us while we are safe. 

We can all **lucrate throught a platform that generates capital flux and fees that get distributed between the users**, and not for the actual institution. The fact of acting all consensually looking for amazing oportunities, helps to split the costs and to reduce the impact on the user.



### Can I cash all out whenever?

Of course! Once the capital is provided, [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) optimizes and maximices your yields automatically, but you can instantly cash them out anytime. All you have to do, is to click ‘**RETIRAR**’ \(Harvest\). Then you will receive in your wallet all the tokens you invested, plus the generated tokens.
