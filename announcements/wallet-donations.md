# Wallet donations

## **The platform's mainnet launch date is approaching!**

As you may know, the platform receives a small percentage of the profits that are allocated to the treasury to cover the expenses of transactions on the blockchain, contracts setup, vaults creation, etc.

Since we are not yet receiving treasury income, **we have decided to launch a wallet to collect donations**. You can send any amount you want, any token is accepted.

The donations collected in this wallet will be transferred to the treasury and from there, they will be distributed to the expenses wallets \(the one for deployments and the Governancemultisig, Operations and Security, as well as the harvest wallet\).
