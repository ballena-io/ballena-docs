# Launch ballena.io v2

**Here it is! The long-awaited LAUNCH of** [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/). After several months of hard work, the dev. team and the community are proud to announce this feat. 

The general interface test plan has been completed, as well as the migration protocol test plan, which are fully operational at the moment. As you may know, the dev. team decided to migrate the BALLE token and redesign certain areas of the project to increase its quality and security. 

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) is launching again and it does so exclusively with the migration function. Users will find this function active until June 10, 2021. This function can be found in the "Migration" section of the left menu of the Dapp.

The migration will come to an end at the block **\#8160245**. From this moment on, the migration of more tokens will not be possible. The approximate date and time of the end of the migration function is as follows:   
  
**Approximately Thu Jun 10 2021 00:00 GMT + 0200** \(The approximate time is not effective, but the block number\).   
  
You can see the block number and the date for its end in the following link: [https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/8160345](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/8160345)
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="info" %}
Connect your wallet containing your BALLE tokens and perform the migration from BALLEv1 to BALLEv2. The change is at a 1:1 rate and the tokens will be added to your wallet directly.
{% endhint %}

The dev. team is currently working on the BalleVaults and the BALLE Staking test plan, which will be released soon. More information shortly.
