# BALLE Staking Pool

## BALLE Staking Pool or Governance Pool

We can add liquidity to the BALLE staking pool in here. This way of investing consists in adding liquidity to BALLE exclusively. Thus, you will receive BALLE tokens as revenue, helping it rise its price at the same time. Apart from its high profitability due to its rising value, you will be able to be part of the governance of the token, meaning users will be able to vote and practice staking gaining some of the platform transaction fees as a reward.

Users actively participating in the Balle Staking Pool will receive 3% of the revenue obtained from the revenue of the platform by all users. They will also be rewarded with an extra 13000 tokens distributed as a multiplier to the 3% fee clearly shown in the Governance App.

Receiving BALLE tokens, as well as an extra reward just for having them deposited in the Staking Pool, makes it a high profitable strategy, especially when the token supply is limited.

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) also permits staking some other crypto assets for the development of the BSC.
