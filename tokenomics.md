## Suministro máximo: 40000 BALLE

Ballena.io cuenta con un suministro máximo de 40000 tokens BALLE. La plataforma no ha llevado a cabo un programa de preventa y el suministro comenzará con el arranque de la plataforma. Se distribuirán gratuitamente al completo entre nuestra comunidad de usuarios y poseedores del token BALLE. Además, una pequeña parte está destinada a nuestro equipo de desarrolladores y a los gastos de fomento y publicidad.

**Distribución porcentual**

La distribución del total fijo e inmutable se compone de:

* **60% - 24000 BALLE tokens:** Distribuido entre todos los usuarios de la plataforma ballena.io.
* **33.3% - 13300 BALLE tokens:** Distribuido entre los holders del token BALLE como reward o premio extra.
* **6.8% - 2700 BALLE tokens:** Dev. Team funds, these are dedicated to the dev team to ensure sustainable and rapid innovation and for promotion actions.

## Details:

**Fixed Supply Tokenomics:** All tokens are minted and will be freely distributed. No more minting possible.

**Utility:** Fees from the ecosystem will go to token holders. From our Yield Optimizer, 3% of user gains will be used to buy BALLE and paid it back to token holders.

## How distribution works

All distribution mechanisms are already implemented in our Smart Contracts. Only a multiplier can be modified in order adjust the rewards rate for certain pools. All info will be clearly stated on the user interface.

### Platform users distribution

This distribution will go over the first year and consists of 24000 BALLE tokens distributed among all users actively participating in our products. Using the BalleVaults, i.e. CAKE-BNB Vault, and using BALLE token governance staking pool allows users receive BALLE tokens as a reward.

Every 3 seconds a BSC block is released. At the same time, a fixed BALLE amount is released per block, which is divided by the number of active vaults on the platform. Users will receive a proportional amount of BALLE token regarding their pool share amount times the multiplier stated on each one of them. This multiplier serves the Dev. Team as an adjustable trimmer for the proper development of the project, thus some of the vaults or pools will reward the user with a greater amount of BALLE tokens.

### BALLE holders distribution

Apart from receiving the user´s proportional amount of those 24000 BALLE tokens as platform users, BALLE holders actively participating in the BALLE staking pool, or governance pool, will be rewarded with an extra 13300 BALLE token distribution.

This extra reward will be distributed as a multiplier to the standard fee allocation among platform users \(regarding the 24000 token distribution\). The extra reward multiplier will clearly appear as a x10, x100 or x200 multiplier in the BALLE staking pool, meaning the user will receive the fees proportional amount of BALLE regarding his pool share multiplied by this value.
