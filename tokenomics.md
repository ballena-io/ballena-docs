## Details:

**Fixed Supply Tokenomics:** All tokens are minted and will be freely distributed. No more minting possible.

**Utility:** Fees from ecosystem will go to token holders. From our Yield Optimizer, 3% of user gains will be used to buy BALLE and get it back to token holders.

**Percentage Breakdown:**
* 60% will go to platform users
* 33.3% will go as an extra reward for holders
* 6.8% are dedicated to the dev team to ensure sustainable and rapid innovation and for promotion actions

## How distribution works

All distribution mecanisms are already implemented in our smartcontracts. Only a multiplier can be changed because we will need to adjust it so we can adjust rewards rate for certain pools. All info will be clearly stated on the user interface anyways.

### Platform users distribution
This distribution will go over the first year of our platform and will give 24,000 BALLE to all users of our products.








### BALLE holders distribution
This distribution will go will give 13,300 BALLE to governance stakers as an extra reward that complements (with a multiplier) the rewards for token holders, for example, 3% performance fee from our Yield Optimizer.
