# Tokenomics

Add Tokenomics

## Max Supply: 80,000 $AUTO

Autofarm started with no pre-farm nor pre-sale. $AUTO are minted linearly starting from 15 December 2020 and will end approximately during October 2021 \(0.008 $AUTO/ block\)

To ensure fair distribution of $AUTO, only vault users \(non-turbo vaults\) would be able to mine $AUTO tokens in addition to the yields from auto-compounding vaults.

## Details:

**Deflationary Tokenomics:** Vault fees \(1.5 - 3.0%\) on vault users' profits are used to perform market buy-backs and these $AUTO are burnt out of supply forever [here](https://bscscan.com/token/0xa184088a740c695e156f91f5cc086a06bb78b827?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).

**Utility:** Fees from Autofarm ecosystem expansion. \(See [Roadmap](https://autofarm-network.gitbook.io/autofarm-network/protocol/roadmap)\)

**Percentage Breakdown:**

* 88% are available for the vault token mining programme
* 12% are dedicated to the team to ensure sustainable and rapid innovation
