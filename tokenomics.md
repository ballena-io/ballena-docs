# Tokenomics

## Max Supply: 40000 BALLE

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) started with no pre-sale and has an immutable max supply of 40000 BALLE token. All of them will be freely distributed to our community of users and holders and a small amount allocated to our Dev. Team and promotion purposes.

### **Percentage Breakdown**

Total fix supply distributed as:

* **60% - 24000 BALLE tokens:** Distributed among all platform users.
* **33.3% - 13300 BALLE tokens:** Distributed among BALLE holders as an extra reward.
* **6.8% - 2700 BALLE tokens:** Dev. Team funds, these are dedicated to the dev team to ensure sustainable and rapid innovation and for promotion actions.



## Details:

**Fixed Supply Tokenomics:** All tokens are minted and will be freely distributed. No more minting possible.

**Utility:** Fees from the ecosystem will go to token holders. From our Yield Optimizer, 3% of user gains will be used to buy BALLE and paid it back to token holders.



## How distribution works

All distribution mechanisms are already implemented in our Smart Contracts. Only a multiplier can be modified in order to adjust the rewards rate for certain pools. All info will be clearly stated on the user interface.

A total of 37300 BALLE tokens will be distributed among Yield Optimizer App and Governance App users accordingly.



### Platform users distribution \(Yield Optimizer App\)

This distribution will work over the first year and consists of 24000 BALLE tokens distributed among all users actively participating in our products. Using the BalleVaults, i.e. CAKE-BNB Vault, will result in a reward of BALLE tokens, apart from increasing your LP tokens, obviously.

Every 3 seconds a BSC block is released. At the same time, a fixed BALLE amount is released per block, which is divided by the number of active vaults on the platform. Users will receive a proportional amount of BALLE token regarding their pool share amount times the multiplier stated on each one of them. This multiplier serves the Dev. Team as an adjustable trimmer for the proper development of the project, thus some of the vaults will reward the user with a greater amount of BALLE tokens.



### BALLE holders distribution \(Governance App\)

BALLE holders actively participating in the Governance APP \(BALLEReward Pool or BALLE Staking Pool\) will receive a 3% of the Yield Optimizer App revenue. Apart from these gains, BALLE holders actively participating in the BALLE staking pool, or governance pool, will be rewarded with an extra 13300 BALLE token distribution.

This extra reward will be distributed as a multiplier to the standard fee allocation resulting from the Yield Optimizer App revenue. The extra reward multiplier will clearly appear as a x10, x100 or x200 multiplier in the BALLE staking pool, meaning the user will receive the fees proportional amount of BALLE regarding his pool share multiplied by this value.
