# Governance

Holders of BALLE! You are eligible to receive part of the profits as you have constructed, you own and govern the Ballena ecosystem. You will receive revenue, for each of the BALLE tokens you hold, that arises from the yielding exercise of this platform. And you will also be eligible to vote any changes on the BALLE platform as a token holder.

These users staking The BALLE tokens into the [Governance Pool](products/balle-staking-pool.md) will receive a 3% of the total revenue from the Yield Optimizer App. This revenue can be withdrawn at any time with no penalty. â€‹



## Extra reward, 13000 BALLE Tokens!

Apart from the stated fee reward earned by the users, they will be allocated an extra reward of 13000 tokens as a multiplier to this fee. Holding BALLE gets really profitable.

The extra reward will be distributed as a multiplier to the standard fee allocation resulting from the Yield Optimizer App revenue. The extra reward multiplier will clearly appear as a x10, x100 or x200 multiplier in the BALLE staking pool, meaning the user will receive the fees proportional amount of BALLE regarding his pool share multiplied by this value.

The revenue will then be generated as BALLE tokens in the [Governance Pool](products/balle-staking-pool.md) and can be harvested at any time with no penalty.



## Wallet Safety

We are glad to announce **We are the first project working with Gnosis** Multisig system in the Binance Smart Chain. 

A multiple signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that controls access and changes to one or more Smart Contracts. Most of the community governed projects in the Ethereum network often require multiple signers to approve a transaction before it will be executed. In Binance Smart Chain, we are the first project implementing Gnosis Safe to run our DAO. 

In BALLE we have designed a 2 safes structure:

1. The treasury operations protocol. The treasury consists of 9 wallets, where 6 of 9 community wallet signers must agree to sign a transaction before a Smart Contract can be implemented oor any changes made regarding trasury funds.
2. The emergency safe protocol, where only 2 main signatures are required in order to perfom some actions. These actions include safety features like closing a failing or hacked vault, i.e.
