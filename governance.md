Holders of BALLE! You are eligible to receive part of the profits as you have constructed, you own and govern the Ballena ecosystem. You will receive revenue, for each of the BALLE tokens you hold, that arises from the yielding exercise of this platform. And you will also be eligible to vote any changes on the BALLE platform as a token holder.

The profits generated by staking The BALLE tokens into the [Governance pool](https://github.com/ballena-io/ballena-docs/tree/23d12f69448b93de42939ba0ba0784acfaba4967/link/README.md)are sent as WBNB to the pool and are proportional to the number of BALLE tokens staked. This revenue can be withdrawn at any time with no penalty. ​

### !!!!!! **Multisig** 

A multiple signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that controls access and changes to one or more Smart Contracts. Most of the community governed projects in the Ethereum network often require multiple signers to approve a transaction before it will be executed. In Binance Smart Chain, we are the first project implementing Gnosis Safe to run our DAO. In BALLE we implemented as 6 of 9 wallets, where 6 of 9 community wallet signers must agree to sign a transaction before a Smart Contract can be implemented.
