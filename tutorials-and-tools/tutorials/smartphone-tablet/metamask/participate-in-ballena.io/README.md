# Participate in ballena.io

This is the end of all the previous steps. We will find **two different ways to participate in**[ **ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/)**üêã**. The idea is to start from the first to be able to continue with the second.

### **1. Participate in a BalleVault and generate BALLEv2 tokens**

Through the steps explained in this section, we will invest our money in a BalleVault in[ **ballena.io**](https://app.ballena.io/)üêã. As we already know, the platform will give us high returns on the invested assets and, in addition, it **will reward us with BALLEv2 tokens**.

**Learn more about the method ballena uses to multiply our investment in** [**this link**](../../../../../getting-started-1/getting-started.md)**.**

### **2. Provide liquidity for the BALLEv2 tokens in the Staking Pool.**

The BALLEv2 tokens accumulated in the previous process are NOT recommended to be sold or exchanged, as a gradual rise in value is expected over time. The best place for these BALLEv2 is the Staking Pool of[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/)üêã. This is a DApp developed by our team that offers us the option to **reinvest BALLEv2 tokens to generate more BALLEv2 tokens. The performance is massively exponential.**

In addition, being holders of BALLEv2, we can be part of the [**Governance**](../../../../../technical/governance.md) of the platform.

Let's learn about the first step on the next page:
