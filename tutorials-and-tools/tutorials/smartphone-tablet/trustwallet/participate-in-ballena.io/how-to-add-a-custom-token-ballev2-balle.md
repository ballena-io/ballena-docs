# How to add a custom token: BALLEv2 \(BALLE\)

This tutorial is valid for any token.

The **BALLE** tokens **enter your wallet when** you **buy** them **or** when you **harvest** the profits of a BalleVault. However, they **may NOT be reflected on the token list** of Trust Wallet.

**We need to add the token's contract** to Trust Wallet so we are able to see our BALLE balance. Follow these simple steps.



### 1. First things first: **find out the BALLEv2 contract address.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Always get the contract from a ballena.io official site.**
{% endhint %}

**BALLEv2 contract address:** 0x9714C04b34E6300964161c3aC37b86451E79152d



### **2. Access Trust Wallet**

In the main screen of your wallet, click the button in the upper right corner.
