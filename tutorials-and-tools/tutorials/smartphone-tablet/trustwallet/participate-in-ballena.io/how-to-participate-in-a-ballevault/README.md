# How to participate in a BalleVault

Navigate to[ **ballena.io**](https://app.ballena.io/)**🐋** and choose a pair that feels attractive \(eg: bALBT/BNB\).

We will first use the **PancakeSwap DApp** to **exchange our BNB for** the other **asset \(bALBT\)** that makes up the pair we have chosen.

Also in PancakeSwap we will **add liquidity** for those two assets \(bALBT and BNB\) to **create the pair and receive LP \(Liquidity Provider\) tokens.** These LP tokens represent the value of our investment and this is what we will be investing in the BalleVault of [**ballena.io**](https://app.ballena.io/)**🐋** to **generate returns.**

It may sound complicated but we will go step by step, no worries.



We start on the following page:

If you already own both tokens of the pair, you can go straight to this link:
