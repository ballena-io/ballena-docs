# Add liquidity to a Liquidity Pool

## How to add liquidity in PancakeSwap through Trust Wallet

It is possible to add liquidity to any pair we want, as long as the two currencies in the pair are in equal parts and as long as it is available on the[ **ballena.io**](https://app.ballena.io/)**üêã** platform. In this tutorial we will focus on adding liquidity to the bALBT/BNB pair.

### **1. Still on PancakeSwap in the Trust Wallet DApps browser.**

### **2. Go to the "Liquidity" tab.**

In the Trade ‚Üí Liquidity section, click on "Add Liquidity".

### **3. Add liquidity.**

In one box select BNB and in the other one pick bALBT. **Tap** _**MAX**_ **in the bALBT box** and, automatically, the corresponding amount of BNB will be added in its respective box. Click on "Approve bALBT" below and confirm.

### **4. Click on ‚ÄúSupply‚Äù and then on ‚ÄúConfirm Supply‚Äù.**

We then approve the transaction to finally add our tokens to the platform and thus create the pair.

### **5. Double check.**

**We will obtain LP \(Liquidity Provider\) tokens** that **demonstrate we are liquidity providers** in PancakeSwap and that **represent the value of our contribution**. In exchange for providing liquidity, we will get a small share of the fees generated by that Liquidity Pool.

Keep in mind that when we provide liquidity, the two tokens of the added pair will no longer be displayed in our Trust Wallet wallet. Instead, we can find _Pancake LPs_. These have the same value and are exchangeable at any time.

### **6. Liquidity has been successfully provided and we have received LP tokens.**

We still need to add those LP tokens to a BalleVault in[ ballena.io](https://app.ballena.io/)üêã and optimize profits exponentially:
