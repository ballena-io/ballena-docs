# How to trade BNB for another Token on PancakeSwap

### **1. Access PancakeSwap in the Trust Wallet DApps browser.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Never change all the BNB to be able to pay the fees for the BSC network transactions.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**If the DApps search engine does not connect to the site, make sure that the network we are using is the "Smart Chain" \(BSC\).**
{% endhint %}

### **2. Points to consider.**

* Our intention is to **invest in a Liquidity Pool \(LP\)** for which we will need to **create a pair**. As an example, we will use the **bALBT/BNB pair**.
* In order to explain and understand it in a simple way, we will put it all as if our **total value** were exactly **2.05 BNB**.
* Before continuing, we **subtract a small amount \(0.05\) of BNB** from our total value and we forget about it, since this portion will automatically be used for the **payment of transaction fees** from now on.
* Therefore, our **total available value is 2 BNB**.



### **3. We select the tokens.**

In the _Trade â†’ Exchange_ section of PancakeSwap, we start with BNB in the "From" box, and in the "To" box, in _Select a currency,_ we look up for bALBT. It is always best to directly copy the contract of the desired token in[ bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/) and paste it into the token search bar.

### **4. Swap parameters.**

In order to create the **bALBT/BNB pair we will need to add both assets in equal parts**. Therefore, if we have 2 BNB, we will need to **exchange exactly 1 BNB for bALBT**. We choose the amount of BNB and below it will appear the amount of bALBT that we will receive. We press "Swap" and confirm the transaction.

### **5. Swap completed.**

We now hold 1 BNB and its corresponding value in bALBT.
