# First steps: Binance

We will go through the required steps regarding Binance in this tutorial.

Binance is an exchange where we will deposit our money, after setting up an account, and we will buy BNB. This cryptocurrency \(BNB\) will let us operate in the BSC where our platform operates.

We want to maximize the yield farmed by our money, so we try to find cryptos and projects that can provide us with high APY and get gone with more money than we had at the start of the day. Our project[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/), as you may know, is in charge of the automation and optimization of your investment. We will need BNB tokens in order to operate in our platform.

That's why we are here, so let's start purchasing those BNB tokens following all the steps below. Click in this link in order to navigate to the first Binance tutorial, Set up a Binance Account.
