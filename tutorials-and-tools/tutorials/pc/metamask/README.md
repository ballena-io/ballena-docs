# MetaMask

MetaMask is a **wallet where we can store** any kind of **coins**. It's also a **software** that, installed as an extension of our web browser, **allows** us **to** **interact**  and **to connect** our **funds** **with** any **blockchain**.

This tutorial explains how to **set up a MetaMask wallet** from scratch and how to **set** the **Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) network** to be able to operate on its blockchain and the DApps that are in it.

Also how to **add a custom token** like **BALLEv2 \(BALLE\)** to the wallet.
