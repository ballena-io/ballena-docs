# How to Add a Custom Token to MetaMask

During the process of[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/)üêã you will work with several tokens, but MetaMask does not have the information for all of them. This does NOT mean that they will not be compatible with your wallet. It means that even if you are a holder of the token, it will not be reflected in your wallet. **You will need to add the information \(the contract\) of the token** to MetaMask so that it appears on the list of tokens and to **able to see its balance**.

**We will put the BALLEv2 \(BALLE\) token as an example** since it is the main character of this odyssey and because it is the only token that we know with certainty that we will handle.

We recommend **always adding the tokens to MetaMask before sending funds** to the wallet to avoid any scare.

\*\*\*\*

### 1. Open MetaMask on the top right corner of your browser.
