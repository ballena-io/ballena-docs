# How to trade BNB for another Token on PancakeSwap - PC

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to trade your BNB for another token. This way we will be able to add liquidity to the selected pair and we will add LP tokens to a BalleVault.

‌**Remember**: In order to add liquidity to a LP pair we will need the same vaule for both assets. You will have to make the swap in an exchange if you only hold BNB.

‌In this example we will swap BNB for Balbt.

### **6. Introduce the desired amount of BNB and click "Swap".**

**‌**If we want to add liquidity to a LP token pair, remember we will need the same value for both assets, meaning we will have to swap almost half of our BNB tokens.

**Remember:** Fees are paid with BNB in the BSC projects, so **ALWAYS** leave some spare BNB tokens. Do not swap the exact half of your tokens but a little bit less.

### **8. Done!**

Your tokens should show up in your Metamask account. In case you can't see them, make sure you have already added the token to your Metamask\`s token list. Go to this tutorial on [How to Add a Custom Token to Metamask](../set-up-metamask-pc/how-to-add-a-custom-token-to-metamask.md) if needed.
