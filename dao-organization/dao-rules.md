# DAO Rules

Our DAO is a transparent organization managed by the smart contracts. However, its members have the ability to propose and vote on new proposals. For this, a series of rules have been established to guarantee its correct development.

* Any member of the BALLE Governance \(who owns the BALLE token\) can **create proposals**.
* Any member of the BALLE Governance \(who owns the BALLE token\) can **vote on proposals**.
* The **weight of each user's vote will be proportional to the number of BALLE tokens** they have.
* Creating and voting on proposals is **free**.
* Proposals shall be created following our [Standarization Rules](other-tutorials/create-propolsals.md#standarization).
* Users will not be able to participate in the voting for proposals created prior to their purchase of the BALLE token. More information in [Block Number](sourcecred-system/).
* Proposals have a closing **deadline**. This date is defined by the author of the proposal but always complying with the minimum established duration.
* Users who join the community will start with the **Newcomer** role, which is equivalent to the TL0 trust level. They will be able to move up a level by contributing and being part of the project. For more information click on [Trust Levels](trust-levels.md).
* Users who actively participate in the community can be rewarded with BALLE tokens through the SourceCred system. For more information click on [SourceCred](sourcecred-system/).
* The project and the community are open to new users without discrimination.
* Users can leave the project at their will.
* Users **shall always watch over the progress of the project** above their personal interests.
