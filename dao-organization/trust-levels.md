# Trust Levels

## **\*\* IN PROGRESS \*\***

## **Motivation**

The project[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) is governed by the form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\). Despite having a decentralized power, the project divides the contributors into groups determined by development areas and, in turn, in Trust levels to guarantee its adequate progress.

As you may know, the DAO is open to any user in the community to join and contribute to the project. Their contribution is also rewarded in the form of BALLE tokens through the SourceCred system. This premise gives the project a free and open character in terms of admitting contributors in favor of the development of new areas and improvement of existing ones. Remember that the goal of DAO is to create, by and for the community.

The negative part of this remuneration and participation system is that it increases the vulnerability of the project. On the one hand, the governance system implemented is more susceptible to attacks by users, due to the transparency and open nature of the project, and on the other hand, it is also more susceptible to misuse of the Cred and poor quality contributions.

This is why the contribution system is based on Trust Levels \(TL\). These protect the development of the project by requiring a level of trust gained in the community to get access to modifying files, for example. This system requires that users who try to position themselves in the high levels of contribution, have previously been known by the rest of the community and have earned the trust of it through various filters by contributing, both in debates and, above all, in content contributions.
