# Trust Levels

## **\*\* IN PROGRESS \*\***

## **Motivation**

The project[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) is governed by the form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(DAO\). Despite having a decentralized power, the project divides the contributors into groups determined by development areas and, in turn, in **Trust levels** to guarantee its adequate progress.

As you may know, **the DAO is open to any user in the community** to join and contribute to the project. Their contribution is also rewarded in the form of BALLE tokens through the SourceCred system. This premise gives the project a free and open character in terms of admitting contributors in favor of the development of new areas and improvement of existing ones. Remember that th**e goal of DAO is to create, by and for the community**.

The negative part of this remuneration and participation system is that it increases the vulnerability of the project. On the one hand, the governance system implemented is more susceptible to attacks by users, due to the transparency and open nature of the project, and on the other hand, it is also more susceptible to misuse of the Cred and poor quality contributions.

This is why the **contribution system is based on Trust Levels \(TL\)**. These protect the development of the project by requiring a level of trust gained in the community to get access to modifying files, for example. This system requires that users who try to position themselves in the high levels of contribution, have previously been known by the rest of the community and have earned the trust of it through various filters by contributing, both in debates and, above all, in content contributions.

## **Trust Levels \(TL\)**

Trust levels try to categorize community members into several groups to ensure proper use of the SourceCred system and ensure the safety of the project.

The levels are divided into **TL0, TL1, TL2, and TL3**. These denote the community's trust in the user, as well as in the contribution that the user makes. As the user levels up, the more weight they have in the community and therefore **more responsibility falls on them**.



### **TL0**

The user gets involved in the community but practically does not participate in the conversation of any of the channels.

It is a perfect stage for acquiring information and visiting all the project channels. The TL0 can become familiar with the bases of the project, the organization and the different areas of it, and in turn, see if it is capable of providing quality content to it.

* Role: Newcomer.
* Cred Value: x0.
* White color.
* He is not recognized as an active member of the community.
* The user does not get retribution of any kind.
