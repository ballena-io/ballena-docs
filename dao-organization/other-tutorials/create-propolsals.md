# Create propolsals

## Standarization‌

Standarization should be a must at the time of a propolsal creation. Follow this guidelines for this purpose:

* The proposals will be published in **both languages**, English and Spanish. Divide these two versions by “/” or “====” symbols. Check this example.
* Spanish will always be the first language to be used.
* In case any of the fields does not allow any more words to be typed in, Spanish language shall have priority over the English.
* A **TLDR** shall be included as a recap at the end of the description field. The **TLDR** will serve as a direct question to the matter.
* The proposal, TLDR and the choices shall be completely neat and concise.
* The duration of the proposals shall be:
  * **Momentous decision: 72 hours**.
  * **Non-momentous decision: 24 hours**.
* Once the proposal has been published, the user shall notify the community through the **\#votaciones** channel on our Discord.

## Block Number

‌

The **block number** is a really important data number. This will serve as a filter for users which are eligible to participate in the voting process of a proposal. Users will only be able to vote on a proposal in case the user had BALLE tokens prior to its creation.

‌The **block number** acts as a registration number at the time of a proposal´s creation and blocks users that are not eligible to vote on it.  


This number is predefined and the user should not care about it.
