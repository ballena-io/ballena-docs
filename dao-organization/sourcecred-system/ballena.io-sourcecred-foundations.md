# ballena.io SourceCred foundations

 **\*\* IN PROGRESS** \*\*

The new structure includes the incorporation of new areas such as “Social” or “Design”, areas where great effort was found to be involved. An updated **list of areas** as follows:

* Project Lead.
* Blockchain.
* FrontEnd.
* Documentation.
* Security.
* **Strategies.**
* **Design.**
* **Communication.**
* **Accounting.**

A **leader will be assigned** for each of the areas, who will be in charge of its management. This position will be subject to the minimum working quality and quantity required for this charge, therefore making **this role into a rotating one**. **Leaders can be removed, changed or maintained depending on the DAO´s judgement.**

## The Graph <a id="9c7b"></a>

[**ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/) is powered by the **SourceCred graph**. We, the BALLE community, build our own personal version of SourceCred that is tailored to **our specific requirements and needs**. It represents Decentralized Autonomous Value.

You can check our **SourceCred instance** here:

* **Link**: [https://cred.ballena.io](https://cred.ballena.io/)

The [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) community can be modeled as a sum of our connections. Each connection you make to another human is recorded in the graph, tailoring your rewards to your engagement, and vice versa, others rewards to your \(and the rest of the communities\) engagement. To do this, SC created a specialized algorithm.

## Cred <a id="cd71"></a>

> Enter Cred! But first…
>
> How can you possibly assign a score to a person?
>
> How can you assign value to a person?
>
> Easy, WE don’t, **YOU do**.

The same systems Siri uses to listen and understand you is used in SourceCred to calculate your Cred score. Thousands/millions of balancing actions occur behind the graph to get you your number. This number, known as a Cred score, is your little percentage of the BALLE community.

## Giving and Receiving Cred <a id="0659"></a>

* **Rule 1:** Cred is never lost.
* **Rule 2**: We can change the distribution rules anytime we want.

Cred is costless, inflationary, and intrinsic. That’s what makes it great. Cred is shareable. **When you give Cred you do not lose Cred. instead you mint more Cred to give**. Give Cred, and you’re more likely to get Cred in return. Just keep in mind: “With great power there must also come great responsibility”. Reward your heroes!

## Weight System <a id="ae31"></a>

SourceCred uses weights to measure how much Cred you want to give. Is important for you to understand that we can change this algorithm as much as we want. Anytime. You can suggest any proposal on our [voting platform](https://vote.ballena.io/#/).

## Initial values for the ballena.io weight  system <a id="47e1"></a>

### Github

* **Pull Request** : 16 Cred
* **PR Review** : 1 Cred

### Discord

* **Weight — — — — Value**

#### **Channel weights**

* \# 💙 gracias — — 15x
* \# 🎉 éxito — — — 12x
* \# 🆘 soporte — — 3x

#### **Role weights**

* no role — — — — — 0x
* @ premium — — — 0x
* @ oldfags — — — —0x
* @ contributors — —2x
* @ team- leads — — 3x

#### **Emoji weights**

* 👎 emoji — — — —0x
* 💥 emoji — —— — 0x
* All other emoji — —1x

The weights apply **multiplicatively**, which means a emoji from a Team Lead member on the **\# 💙 gracias** channel is worth 1 \* 15 \* 3 = 45 Cred.

## About channels <a id="967e"></a>

### \#💙gracias <a id="baed"></a>

This channel is used to **mention a user** who has helped you in private, as far as the construction of the project is concerned, when the Github retribution system cannot contemplate it. It is made for **granting Cred directly to a user and not for receiving it**. 

Therefore, all **posts must be accompanied by a mention**. Otherwise, your contribution will be invalidated.

### \#🎉éxito <a id="d98d"></a>

In this channel, users **publish feats or contributions of great value** made so that the rest of the members can thank them. 

This way, the **users of the community will be able to react to these publications made by the contributor, thus granting them the cred** they deserve.

## Distribution of Grain \(BALLE Token\) <a id="967e"></a>

All of SourceCred’s effort gives us percentages. Percentages of the token that is distributed to each member. [**ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/) ****can use these to dish out BALLE tokens. SourceCred provides us with what members have earned over this week and over all time. This can be deemed a **verifiable fair distribution**.
