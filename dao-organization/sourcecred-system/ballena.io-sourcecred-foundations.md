 **\*\* IN PROGRESS** \*\*

The new structure includes the incorporation of new areas such as “Social” or “Design”, areas where great effort was found to be involved. An updated **list of areas** as follows:

* Project Lead.
* Blockchain.
* FrontEnd.
* Documentation.
* Security.
* **Strategies.**
* **Design.**
* **Communication.**
* **Accounting.**

A **leader will be assigned** for each of the areas, who will be in charge of its management. This position will be subject to the minimum working quality and quantity required for this charge, therefore making **this role into a rotating one**. **Leaders can be removed, changed or maintained depending on the DAO´s judgement.**
