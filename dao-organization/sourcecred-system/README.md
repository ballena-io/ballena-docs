# SourceCred System

We have created this governance mechanism to encourage community members and liquidity providers to participate in it and to **compensate these people** for doing so.

The first initiative as part of this incentive program is the **implementation of a** [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/) __**instance** to track contributions to the [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) community.

This proposal looks to leverage [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/) to **distribute a fixed amount of BALLE per week based on the Cred and Grain scores** accumulated by users across Github and the governance channels in Discord.

Find more details about [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/)´s **Cred records** in the following link:

To be eligible for these rewards, community members should participate in this collaboration program run by our DAO.

## Motivation <a id="c099"></a>

The introduction of ‘soft’ incentives around governance in Maker have improved the quantity, quality and diversity of contributions.

We aim to **empower these contributions in the** [ballena.io ](https://ballena.io/)**ecosystem via a suite of governance incentive programs**. We believe that there is a much broader space for participation in the BALLE community from people and groups who may not have the capital to become LPs, or who otherwise choose not to do so.

After the last dev. team meeting, the issues related to token distribution regarding this last team arose. As [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) aims a community led DAO, **the contribution rewarding system should be a major concern** for the design of this project.

We are committed for a **long-term sustainable project**, meaning we are committed for a fair and long-term viable way of resource allocation that ensures the non-stop project´s progression. Although having initially assigned the corresponding amount for each of the dev. team members, the measure taken consists of a reduction in the dev. team leaders´ allocation, meaning an increase in the available tokens for the rest of the contributors. This way, community users will find a lucrative opportunity to enrich the project, be part of it and feel motivated while being **rewarded for their efforts**.

This is the way we found to be the most suitable for what we, at [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/), are aiming for. Our goal is to **bring together the greatest thinkers**, work together in innovative solutions and continue evolving as a **unique project for the long-term**.

The **tokens will be distributed as a reward to contributors individually based upon the Cred´s score gained by contributing on the required tasks**. The idea for the rewards distribution is mainly based upon the cred system’s analytics. However, human intervention will be required to readjust these values for the proper compensation for users’ work. The dev. team leaders will supervise this analytics and readjust the cred’s parameters consequently.

This way, community members will be eligible for task performing and being rewarded with BALLE tokens to do so. Leaders will publish contributor vacants and simple tasks when required. 

## Specification <a id="11ad"></a>

The [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) [SourceCred Instance](https://cred.ballena.io/#/) was set up in March 2021 and has been collecting contribution data ever since.

We propose that BALLE tokens are **distributed to contributors based on the Cred scores** recorded by SourceCred **and the subsequent grain \(or BALLE\) scores** earned among active participants. For more on how this works, please see this [documentation](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/grain/).

The following specification details our proposed structure for these incentives. Inspiration for the allocations and configuration of this instance were modeled after the [MakerDAO SourceCred Trial.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/luww3z/sourcecred_maker_dao/)

## Discord Incentives <a id="63e8"></a>

We’ve noticed community members on Discord play an active role in educating new users as well as providing valuable feedback and discussion around protocol governance. Through this integration, we want to create mechanisms for those actions to be easily validated and rewarded.

The first instance of Discord incentives **will track activity** in most of the Discord channels, rewarding participants for meaningful contributions in the same way as Github activity — focused on reactions as opposed to post volume to push towards a **‘quality over quantity approach’**.

This program looks to serve as an ongoing medium for community members to be better rewarded for their discussion in Discord, with ambitions to boost the importance of BALLE emojis and token-based roles.

## Github Incentives <a id="0743"></a>

Project development takes place on several GitHub repositories managed by front end and banck end Leads. **Code contributions will be taken in consideration for Cred calculations**, so all developers who want to participate on the project can benefit from it.

## Funding <a id="b2bc"></a>

The proposed **funding for SourceCred incentives consist of 40 BALLE per week**.

This total quantity of tokens is the sum of 30 tokens, corresponding to the contributions made during the same week and 10 tokens, which correspond to the contributions made during the past 10 weeks, approximately.

Based on a weekly decay of 0.16, the 50% of the total rewards is distributed in accordance to the contributions made during the whole month, the 25% is distributed according to the last month´s contributions, the 12.5% is distributed in accordance to the one before, and so on.

This way, contributors will be able to leave the dev. efforts for a few days with almost no impact on their revenue.

## Drawbacks <a id="4839"></a>

Some points to consider around the introduction of SourceCred incentives for contributions to the [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) ****Discord and Github sites:

* There is potential for this program to be exploited using bots or through collusion between actors. We will be monitoring the rewards distributed by the instance and will take action if malicious activity occurs.
* The corresponding cred could be misleading as the algo could not correctly rate users´ contribution. Please note that the dev. team will closely follow-up the cred´s steps and take action if necessary.

## Notes <a id="2169"></a>

Please note that this program aims to ramp up in the event that it is successful, and we believe that starting with smaller allocations and building up as time goes on is the best way to approach these incentives.
