# DAO Introduction

## **DECENTRALIZED FINANCE FOR EVERYBODY**

\*\*\*\*

[**ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/) **project is managed at its 100% by the community and all users are eligible to vote and take part in the decision-making process.**  


Whether you are part of the Governance team, or whether you are willing to, you are in the right place. **The project** [**ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/) **belongs to its community**, it´s ours, it flies away from the traditional company structure and brakes with the commonly established centralised hierarchy for giving **the power and the benefits to its community members**.

The blockchain tech is changing **the investment funds management**. Traditional banking institutions are partially losing control of the market they were comfortably well established in. The Blockchain is a game changing technology seeking the **decentralization** that we have all lost.

* Have you ever thought in a society where the fees go directly to all users and not to some few wallets?
* Have you ever dreamt of a community led company?

That is exactly what our DAO is, this is what is all about.



**Our DAO is autonomously managed by the deployed Smart Contracts**. They are clearly published in BSCScan \(See Tokenomics\) and immutable, meaning no user will be able to modify them, not even ballena.io´s dev. team. Only through the proposal and voting of new ideas the platform will suffer new modifications or implementations, and this decision-making process is completely led by the user. **You, as a member of our community, will be heard and you will be able to decide the direction this DAO takes.**

You will be able to **propose new ideas** which will be studied and voted among all members in the community seeking the success of the project.

The tr**easury related operations rely on a** [**Multi-signature system called Gnosis**](../technical/governance.md#wallet-safety). This means the new ideas will be proposed in our community, voted by all members and before **any transaction or change** becomes effective, it **will need** **the approval of a minimum number of users**.
