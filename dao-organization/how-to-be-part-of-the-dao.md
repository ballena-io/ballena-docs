# How to be part of the DAO

\*\***IN PROGRESS**\*\*

**The governance of** [**ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/) **is made up of all the users involved in our community** who own the BALLE token. As you may know, [ballena.io ](https://ballena.io/)is 100% managed by the community that makes it up and BALLE holders will be able to **participate in the decision-making process**. 

In addition, the DAO has a very active community in which users can take part in the development process of the project. Users can join our Discord channel and familiarize themselves with the content to begin their input to improve the project. 

The DAO relies on the SourceCred system to distribute a fixed amount of BALLE per week based on the Cred and Grain scores accumulated by users on Github and the governance channels on Discord.
