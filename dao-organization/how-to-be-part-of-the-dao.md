# How to be part of the DAO

**The governance of** [**ballena.io**](https://ballena.io/) **is made up of all the users involved in our community** who hold the BALLE token. As you may know, [ballena.io ](https://ballena.io/)is 100% managed by the community that makes it up and BALLE holders will be able to **participate in the decision-making process**. 

In addition, our DAO has a very active community in which users can take part in the development process of the project. Users can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ydRbEAaqqc) channel and familiarize themselves with the content to begin their contribution to improve the project. 

Our DAO relies on the [SourceCred ](sourcecred-system/)system to distribute a **fixed amount of BALLE per week based on the Cred and Grain scores accumulated by users** on Github and the governance channels on Discord.
