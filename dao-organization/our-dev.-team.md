# Our Dev. Team

The [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) project is **driven by its community members** who  actively participate in it. They contribute content to the project in their areas of knowledge and skills, trying to bring together the best thinking heads to obtain the best results in each of the areas.

Contributors are coordinated through the [ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) [Discord](https://discord.gg/PuypCMpE) where, through the different channels corresponding to these areas, they propose and discuss ideas regarding the development of the project. 

You can find an updated **list of areas currently under development** here**:**

* Project management. 
* Blockchain. 
* Frontend. 
* Documentation. 
* Security. 
* Design. 
* Strategies. 
* Communication.

A leader is assigned for each of these areas, who will be in charge of its management. This position is subject to the minimum quality and quantity of work required for this position, meaning this role is on a rotating basis. Leaders may be removed, replaced, or kept in charge based upon the discretion of the DAO. In addition, each area has permanent "Contributors", as well as users who are willing to help from time to time, denoted as "Community".

Users are classified into **four main roles** that are **linked to Trust Levels**. These roles follow a hierarchy within the DAO in order to maintain order in the organization, maximizing safety, collaboration, and quality of the contributions. The main roles are as follows:

* **Newcomer** - TL0. 
* **Communtiy** - TL1. 
* **Contributor** - TL2. 
* **Area Leader** - TL3.

The contribution to the project is **open to any user** who wants to be part of it. All you have to do is join our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/PuypCMpE)and get involved.

Start reading our documentation, especially the technical documentation and our DAOÂ´s documentation. Join in and familiarize yourself with the [Discord ](https://discord.gg/PuypCMpE)channels. There is a channel for each of the areas and many more. 

Once you feel comfortable and understand how the organization works, you can begin to participate in the conversations, as well as propose ideas and be part of the daily discussions. In the event that you especially fit into one of the areas and believe that you can provide quality content, try to contribute to the corresponding channel and let the team that participates there know that. You will be pleasantly welcome. For more information about the process of getting involved and the progress as a contributor, consult the document [Trust Levels](trust-levels.md).

## **Trust Levels**

Users participating in the community are classified by established **Trust Levels**, ranging from TL0 to TL3, which are linked to each of the main roles. These levels denote, as their name suggests, the **community's trust in these users**, and therefore, the higher the level, the greater the responsibility that falls on them.

The DAO is **open to the contribution of any user** who joins in the community and, therefore, requires a certain organization to ensure the safety and quality of the project. These levels give the organization an orderly character to avoid possible attacks and, essentially, to have control over the remuneration of contributors.

Every Sunday of each week the changes, incorporations and abandonment of the Trust Levels system and contributors become effective.

## Remuneration

Contributors are remunerated in the form of BALLE tokens through the SourceCred system. We are **committed to a long-term sustainable project**, which means that we are committed to a fair and viable way of allocating resources that ensures the continuous progression of the project. This way, community users will find a lucrative opportunity to enrich the project, be a part of it, and feel motivated while being rewarded for their efforts.

The tokens will be distributed as a reward to contributors based on the Cred score obtained by contributing to the required tasks. The reward distribution system is mainly based on the analysis of the Cred system.
