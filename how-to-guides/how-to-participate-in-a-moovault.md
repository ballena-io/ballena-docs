### 5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and click “DEPOSIT” <a id="5-confirm-the-transaction-in-your-wallet-and-click-deposit"></a>

Click on **25%, 50%, 75% or 100%** or any percentage to deposit the corresponding proportion of your wallet into the Vault.

Or click “Deposit All” if you would like to **deposit 100%** of the chosen digital asset from your wallet into the Vault. :::info Please note before you make a deposit that there is a **0.1% withdrawal fee**. The longer you leave the deposit to earn returns in the Vault, the more likely your returns will exceed the withdrawal fee. :::

### 6. Receive your mooToken \(in this case it would be mooFryWBNBv2\) <a id="6-receive-your-mootoken-in-this-case-it-would-be-moofrywbnbv-2"></a>

The mooToken you receive is your **share of the mooFryWBNBv2 Vault**. The amount of mooFryWBNBv2 in your wallet will **remain constant** over time but the value of it will increase as the WBNB Vault earns returns.

The amount of mooFryWBNBv2 you receive will be less than 1 per WBNB you deposited because mooFryWBNBv2 is worth more than WBNB.

That's it, once the harvest function is called, you are already earning yield.
