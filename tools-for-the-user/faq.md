## Products

#### **1. BalleVaults**

The BalleVaults **increase your LP tokens** for the corresponding pair. If the user adds liquidity to the pool CAKE-BNB, he will find that the LP tokens increase as the time goes by. These **users will also receive a BALLE tokens reward** from the 24000 tokens distribution. These BALLE can then be used for staking at the BALLE Staking Pool found at the Governance APP. More info in Products.

**‌**

#### **2. BALLE Staking**

#### **4. APR/APY**

The APY is the **Annual Percentage Yield**. Assets added to the liquidity of a pool will generate yields along the whole year shown as APY. The APY is **taking into account the auto-compound**, meaning the reinvestment of all the returns gained in the pool.[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) takes care of the auto-compound and shows the APY, thus. On the other hand, the APR is the **Annual Percentage Rate** and doesn't take into account the compound interest.

**‌**

#### **5. Why some weird APY values?**

If the APY values look weird or don't appear, usually means **you are not in the proper network**. In case of any bugs in the platform, it would immediately be published in the social media.

**‌**

#### **6. How does auto-compound work?**

The auto-compound is the automatic reinvestment of all your pool gains.[ ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) **harvests your revenue and reinvests it for the gains to be exponential**. A 1% of the platform benefits is used for paying off reinvestment fees.

**‌**

#### **7. What about fees?**

[ballena.io](https://ballena.io/) products must comply with some fees stated below:

* 4% of the revenue from our Yield Optimizer App

   is distributed as:

  * 3% for the BALLE holders actively participating in the BALLE Staking Pool. BALLE tokens are bought with this revenue and distributed among users \(each day, the platform distributes the gains from the day before\).
  * 1% allocated to the project treasury \(this amount faces the reinvesting fees and Smart Contracts deployment fees\).

* 10% of the revenue generated at the BALLE Staking Pool is destined to the project´s treasury for the DAO´s future expenses. This is a temporary fee, applicable while the 12,000 BALLE are distributed through this pool.
* 0.1% is the vaults´ deposit fee.

**‌**

#### **8. Connection error while launching the App**

Newbie users can usually find the message "Connection error" at the time of launching the App. This error is usually due to a **lack of proper configuration of the user´s wallet for the BSC**. Make sure you are on the Binance Smart Chain on your wallet´s network. You can find how to do this in our tutorials.
