# Security and Risks


In the space of crypto, especially in the Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\) space, users have to understand the risks of projects and smart contracts before venturing into DeFi. We call this DYOR \(do your own research\).

### General DeFi Risks

DeFi risks encapsulates a wide range of risks such as [impermanent loss](https://www.bsc.news/post/cryptonomics-what-is-impermanent-loss) to risks of falling for scams such as wallet draining, private key being stolen, et cetera. Hence, DeFi users have to be careful themselves and learn to educate themselves constantly in this space.

### 3rd Party Risks

TODO

Ballena serves as a yield aggregator by providing vaults which auto-compounds rewards. However, vaults does not indicate any partnership or support by ballena.io. We've mitigated this risk by splitting the vaults into 'turbo' and 'non-turbo' based on the individual yield farm's reputability on the BSC space, of which 'turbo' vaults are considered more risky.
