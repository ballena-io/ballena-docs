### Información general

> ballena.io is a yield optimizer app on the Binance Smart Chain which automates investment strategies over yield farming opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem allowing its users to gain revenue through its compound interest technique. BALLE is the ballena.io native governance token. Its maximum supply is 40.000 tokens and no more minting is possible. You can read its tokenomics here [https://docs.ballena.io/v/en/technical/tokenomics](https://docs.ballena.io/v/en/technical/tokenomics). The main products are: \* The BalleVaults, vaults where users can deposit their LP tokens and see how the implemented strategies increase their LP tokens. Users participating in the vaults receive BALLE token rewards during the first year from the launch date. \* The BALLE Staking Pool, where the native BALLE tokens are invested for a revenue optimization while they receive a 3% of the platform gains. An extra BALLE token reward is also distributed in the staking pool till the end of its supply. The ballena.io project is organized as a DAO, it's completely driven by its community. This means that only the proposal and voting of new ideas among the community can lead to significant changes in the project. The treasury related operations rely on a Multi-signature system called Gnosis. This means that before any transaction or change becomes effective, it will need the approval of a minimum number of wallet signatures optimizing the project's security.
